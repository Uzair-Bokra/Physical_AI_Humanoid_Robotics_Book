# Tasks: Module 2 – The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

## PROMPT_TEXT

Create detailed implementation tasks for Module 2 of the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" course, breaking down the work into specific, testable tasks that align with the specification and plan for the digital twin simulation module.

## RESPONSE_TEXT

Created comprehensive implementation tasks document for Module 2 - The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity). The tasks document includes:

- Task 1: Create Module Directory Structure (Status: Pending)
- Task 2: Implement Chapter 1 - Digital Twins & Physics Simulation with Gazebo (Status: Pending)
- Task 3: Implement Chapter 2 - Environment Building & High-Fidelity Simulation (Status: Pending)
- Task 4: Implement Chapter 3 - Sensor Simulation (Status: Pending)
- Task 5: Create Technical Diagrams and Examples (Status: Pending)
- Task 6: Verify Module Integration and Consistency (Status: Pending)

Each task includes:
- Clear status and priority
- Time estimates
- Detailed descriptions
- Specific acceptance criteria with checklists
- Technical notes
- Dependencies, assumptions, and risks
- Success metrics

The tasks align with the functional requirements from the specification and support the implementation approach outlined in the plan. All tasks are designed to be testable and measurable, supporting the success criteria defined in the specification.

## OUTCOME

The tasks document provides a detailed roadmap for implementing Module 2 with clear acceptance criteria and measurable outcomes. Each task is aligned with the specification requirements and supports the overall learning objectives of the digital twin simulation module. The tasks are structured to ensure consistency with Module 1 terminology and proper integration with the ROS 2 ecosystem as specified.
