# Plan: Module 2 – The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

## PROMPT_TEXT

Plan the implementation of Module 2 of the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" course. The module should focus on digital twins, physics simulation with Gazebo, environment building, and sensor simulation using Gazebo and Unity, with integration into the ROS 2 ecosystem.

## RESPONSE_TEXT

Created comprehensive implementation plan for Module 2 - The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity). The plan includes:

- Detailed scope and dependencies analysis
- Key decisions and rationale for technology choices
- Implementation approach with phased development
- Interface and documentation standards
- Non-functional requirements and performance considerations
- Data management and migration strategy
- Operational readiness and quality assurance measures
- Risk analysis and mitigation strategies
- Evaluation and validation criteria

The plan outlines the development of three chapters:
1. Digital Twins & Physics Simulation with Gazebo
2. Environment Building & High-Fidelity Simulation (Gazebo + Unity)
3. Sensor Simulation (LiDAR, Depth Cameras, IMUs)

Each chapter will include learning outcomes, conceptual explanations, and examples aligned with ROS 2-based humanoid simulation workflows. The plan ensures consistency with Module 1 terminology and integrates conceptually with ROS 2 as required.

## OUTCOME

The implementation plan successfully defines the architectural approach for Module 2, including directory structure, content organization, and development workflow. All functional requirements from the specification are addressed, and the plan provides clear guidance for content creation while maintaining alignment with ROS 2 concepts and existing course materials.
