# Tasks: Module 3 – The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)

## PROMPT_TEXT

no implementation just tasks

## RESPONSE_TEXT

Created comprehensive tasks document for Module 3 - The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™). The tasks document includes:

- Phase 1: Setup tasks for module directory structure
- Phase 2: Foundational tasks for Docusaurus integration and terminology consistency
- Phase 3: User Story 1 tasks for Isaac Sim content (P1 priority - MVP)
- Phase 4: User Story 2 tasks for Isaac ROS content (P2 priority)
- Phase 5: User Story 3 tasks for Nav2 content (P3 priority)
- Phase 6: Technical diagram creation tasks
- Phase 7: Polish and validation tasks

The document contains 42 specific tasks with proper ID, parallelization markers [P], and user story labels [US1, US2, US3]. Each task includes exact file paths and follows the required checklist format. The tasks are organized by user story to enable independent implementation and testing, with proper dependencies and execution order defined. The MVP approach focuses on completing User Story 1 (Isaac Sim) as the minimum viable product.

## OUTCOME

The tasks document successfully defines all implementation steps for Module 3 with clear dependencies, parallel execution opportunities, and independent testability for each user story. The document follows the required format and enables both sequential and parallel implementation approaches. All tasks include specific file paths and can be executed independently by an LLM without additional context.
