# Module 4 Tasks - Vision-Language-Action (VLA) & The Autonomous Humanoid

## PROMPT_TEXT

just do the tasks and create a specs and history of it jsut do it no implementation

## RESPONSE_TEXT

Created comprehensive tasks file for Module 4 - Vision-Language-Action (VLA) & The Autonomous Humanoid with:

### Task Structure:
- Phase 1: Setup (9 tasks) - Module directory structure and configuration
- Phase 2: Foundational (8 tasks) - Basic content and integration points
- Phase 3: User Story 1 (8 tasks) - Voice-to-Action systems (Priority: P1)
- Phase 4: User Story 2 (9 tasks) - Cognitive Planning with LLMs (Priority: P2)
- Phase 5: User Story 3 (11 tasks) - Integrated Autonomous System (Priority: P3)
- Phase 6: Technical Diagrams (6 tasks) - Conceptual diagrams and integration
- Phase 7: Polish & Cross-Cutting (6 tasks) - Validation and consistency

### Total Tasks: 57
- Setup: 9 tasks
- Foundational: 8 tasks
- User Story 1: 8 tasks
- User Story 2: 9 tasks
- User Story 3: 11 tasks
- Diagrams: 6 tasks
- Polish: 6 tasks

### Key Features:
- All tasks follow checklist format with proper IDs and story labels
- Parallel execution opportunities identified (52 tasks marked as [P] where applicable)
- Dependencies and execution order clearly defined
- Independent test criteria for each user story
- MVP approach focusing on User Story 1 as minimum viable product
- Cross-references to previous modules for consistency

### Content Coverage:
