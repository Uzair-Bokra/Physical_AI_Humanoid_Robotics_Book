# Chapter 3: Sensor Simulation (LiDAR, Depth Cameras, IMUs)

This chapter explains how humanoid robots perceive the world through simulated sensors and how this data feeds into AI systems. You'll learn about different sensor types, their simulation characteristics, and how to interpret the data they generate.

## Learning Outcomes

After completing this chapter, you will be able to:

- Explain why sensor simulation is critical for robotics development
- Describe the roles of LiDAR, depth cameras, and IMUs in robot perception
- Understand the characteristics of different sensor types and their limitations
- Interpret simulated sensor data streams
- Understand sensor noise and realism in simulation environments
- Trace the data flow from sensors through ROS 2 to AI logic
- Identify common simulation pitfalls and reality gaps with sensors
