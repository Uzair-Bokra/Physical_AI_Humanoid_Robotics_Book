# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

Welcome to Module 2 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course. This module introduces the concept of the Digital Twin and focuses on physics-based simulation, environment construction, sensor simulation, and human-robot interaction using Gazebo and Unity.

## Overview

In this module, you'll explore how digital twins enable safe and efficient development of humanoid robots through realistic simulation environments. You'll learn about physics simulation, environment building, and sensor modeling that form the foundation for advanced AI training in Module 3.

## Learning Outcomes

After completing this module, you will be able to:

- Understand the concept of digital twins in robotics and their value for safe development
- Explain how physics engines affect robot behavior in simulation
- Build meaningful simulation environments for humanoid robots
- Choose appropriate simulation tools (Gazebo vs Unity) based on requirements
- Interpret simulated sensor data and understand simulation vs reality gaps
- Understand the data flow from simulated sensors through ROS 2 to AI systems

## Chapter Structure

This module is organized into three comprehensive chapters:

1. **Digital Twins & Physics Simulation with Gazebo** - Learn the fundamentals of digital twins and physics simulation
2. **Environment Building & High-Fidelity Simulation** - Master environment creation and understand Gazebo vs Unity trade-offs
3. **Sensor Simulation (LiDAR, Depth Cameras, IMUs)** - Understand how robots perceive simulated environments

Let's begin exploring the world of digital twin simulation for humanoid robotics.
