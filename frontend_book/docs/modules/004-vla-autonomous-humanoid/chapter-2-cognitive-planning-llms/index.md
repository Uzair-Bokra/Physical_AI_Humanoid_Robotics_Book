# Chapter 2: Cognitive Planning with LLMs – From Language to ROS Actions

This chapter explores how Large Language Models translate natural language goals into executable robot action sequences, with emphasis on safety constraints and preventing hallucinated actions.

## Learning Outcomes

After completing this chapter, you will be able to:

- Understand the concept of cognitive planning in embodied AI systems and its role in bridging natural language to robotic action
- Explain the role of LLMs in reasoning, task decomposition, and hierarchical planning for robotic systems
