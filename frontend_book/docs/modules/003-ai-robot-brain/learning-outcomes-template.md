# Learning Outcomes Template

This document provides a template for consistent learning outcomes across all content in Module 3.

Each content page should include a "Learning Outcomes" section with the following format:

```markdown
## Learning Outcomes

After studying this section, you should be able to:
- [Learning outcome 1]

```

## Guidelines for Learning Outcomes

- Use action verbs (understand, explain, describe, identify, recognize, apply)
- Focus on what the learner will be able to do after studying the content
- Keep outcomes specific and measurable
- Ensure outcomes align with the overall chapter and module objectives
- Limit to 3-5 outcomes per section to maintain focus
