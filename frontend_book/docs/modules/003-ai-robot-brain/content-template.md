## [Main Section 1]

[Content for the first main topic]

### Subtopic (if needed)
[More detailed content]

## [Main Section 2]

[Content for the second main topic]

## Learning Outcomes

After studying this section, you should be able to:
- [Learning outcome 1]
- [Learning outcome 2]
- [Learning outcome 3]

## Summary

[Brief summary of key concepts covered in this section]

## Guidelines for Conceptual Content

- Focus on intuition and visualization rather than technical implementation details
- Use analogies and real-world examples where appropriate
- Include conceptual diagrams (Mermaid) to illustrate key concepts
- Maintain consistency with terminology from Modules 1 and 2
- Keep explanations accessible to learners with ROS 2 and simulation background
- Avoid implementation details that violate the constraints (no GPU setup, no deep theory, etc.)
