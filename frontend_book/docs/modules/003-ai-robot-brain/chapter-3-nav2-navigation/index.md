# Chapter 3: Nav2 – Autonomous Navigation for Humanoid Robots

This chapter introduces Nav2 as the navigation framework enabling autonomous movement for humanoid robots with awareness of bipedal-specific challenges.

## Learning Outcomes

After completing this chapter, you will be able to:

- Explain what Nav2 is and why it matters for humanoid navigation
- Describe core Nav2 components: maps, localization, path planning, and controllers
- Understand the differences between wheeled and humanoid navigation
- Recognize navigation challenges for bipedal robots: balance, foot placement, and obstacle avoidance
- Understand high-level navigation flow concepts
- Explain the interaction between Nav2 and perception systems
- Reason about humanoid-specific navigation constraints
